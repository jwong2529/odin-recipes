        <h2> Description</h2>
        <p1>It's been a long week so treat yourself to some crispy, perfectly seasoned french fries. It'll be better than any found at fast food chains.</p1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2.5 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1.5 cup water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
            <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time and place in hot oil to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        </ol>
